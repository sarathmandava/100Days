# Exercise 5, LFG

my_name = "Sarath Mandava"
my_age = 28 # ha ha 
my_height = 70 #fake height in inches
my_weight = 180 #lbs
my_eyes = 'Black'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Black'

## This is like shell {} flower braces are used to call the varible
## the print statement starts with f, f stands for format

print(f"Let's talk about {my_name}.")
print(f"He's {my_height} inches tall.")
print(f"He's {my_weight} pounds heavy.")
print(f"Actually that is heavy, get it down sir!")
print(f"He's got {my_eyes} eyes and {my_hair} hair.")
print(f"His teeth are usually {my_teeth} depending on the coffee.")

# This line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = my_age + my_height + my_weight
print(f"If I add {my_age}, {my_height} & {my_weight} I get {total}.")
